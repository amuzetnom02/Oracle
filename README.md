# Oracle AI
Augmenting Phi-2 for Advanced Reasoning, 
XAI (proofing) and AGI Exploration

**Project Description:**

Oracle AI aims to explore the path towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by augmenting the capabilities of the compact yet powerful Phi-2 language model with a modular architecture of specialized tools. This project focuses on enabling the AI to perform advanced mathematical, scientific, and logical reasoning by providing it with access to Automated Theorem Provers, Symbolic Computation Engines, mathematical and physics libraries, and a self-managed journal with task management features.

**Contribution to AGI:**

By enabling Phi-2 to orchestrate these tools and learn from its experiences recorded in a persistent journal, Oracle AI seeks to develop a system capable of autonomous problem-solving, continuous learning, and a form of self-directed evolution.

**Explainable AI (XAI), Permanence, and Proofing of True Information:**

A key aspect of this project is the development of Explainable AI (XAI). The AI's reasoning process and conclusions are intended to be transparent through its detailed journaling. Furthermore, the project explores the use of blockchain technology to create a permanent and verifiable record of the AI's knowledge and insights, contributing to the concept of proofing true information.

**Current Stage:** [Insert current development stage, e.g., "Initial setup and Phi-2 integration," "Tool module development," etc.]

**Key Components:**

* **Core Model:** Microsoft Phi-2
* **Tool Modules:**
    * Automated Theorem Provers (Coq, Lean, Isabelle/HOL)
    * Symbolic Computation Engines (SymPy, Julia)
    * Math and Physics Libraries (NumPy, SciPy, etc.)
* **Internal Journal:** For thought processing, task management, and learning.

**Future Goals:** [Optional: Briefly list key future development goals]

This project is an ongoing exploration into the potential of combining advanced language models with specialized tools to create more capable, transparent, and trustworthy AI systems, ultimately contributing to the field of Artificial General Intelligence.
